/*I'm watching this session live... but
I discovered that I need the previous packages and classes in order to follow along
in Intellij with today's work.

So i'm going to take some notes.
He introduced DDT (data driven testing)
He's using the VyTrack application to run some DDTs
He has opened a two-dimensional Object [][]
he's showing some kind of "test output" report
that we can access from a link in Selenium

We just started the second hour, I think I might be getting lost.
This is a 6-hour day, so I might use this time better by
continuing to go through the videos as I have been...
I'm on Vasyl's "Day 5 Video" now, (which is day 3 of Selenium,
so I'm in the package called day3_Mar3, FirstElementsPractice).
